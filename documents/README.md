# Stacks documentation

Shared and cross-stack docs for the homelab Docker setup.

| Doc | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| [ENV-VARS.md](ENV-VARS.md) | Common environment variables (TZ, locale, per-app) and which stacks use them |
| [ACCESS-SSO.md](ACCESS-SSO.md) | Cloudflare Access SSO for tunnel subdomains (replace basic auth with Google/GitHub/etc.) |

Other guides (backup, monitoring, security) can live here as they’re added.
